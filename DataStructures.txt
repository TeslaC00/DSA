Arrays: Collections of elements, all of the same type, accessible by index.

Linked Lists: Sequences of elements where each element points to the next.

Stacks: Last-in, first-out (LIFO) collections.

Queues: First-in, first-out (FIFO) collections.

Hash Tables/Hash Maps: Key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.

Heaps: Binary trees used to implement priority queues.

Trees: Hierarchical structures with a root element and child elements.

Binary Search Trees (BSTs): Trees where each node has at most two children, with left children being lesser and right children greater.

Graphs: Collections of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges.

Sets: Collections of unique elements.

Tries: Tree-like structures used for storing dynamic sets or associative arrays.

Dictionaries: Key-value pairs similar to hash tables but often with more advanced functionality.

Deques: Double-ended queues allowing insertion and removal from both ends.

Priority Queues: Queues where each element has a priority, and higher-priority elements are dequeued before lower-priority ones.

Matrices: Two-dimensional arrays used for mathematical computations and image data.
